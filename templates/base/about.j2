        <h2>History of SASE</h2>

        <p>The Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) was founded in November 2007 to help Asian heritage scientific and engineering professionals achieve their full potential. Organizations existed for other affinity groups – The National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Society of Women Engineers – and there was a need for a similar organization where students representing all of the pan Asian cultures could connect and support each other.</p>

        <p>In 2007-08, Procter & Gamble Co. provided the initial membership contribution to establish SASE. P&G saw the opportunity to improve the recruiting, retention and development of Asian heritage scientists and engineers via a nationally recognized technical organization with student chapters on college campuses. In 2011 the University of Minnesota SASE chapter was founded with the intention of bringing the initiative from the national SASE chapter to our school. Since then, SASE UMN has created many programs and initiatives that have helped our members grow to become better leaders.</p>
